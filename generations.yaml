    description: "The Omoda E5 (also known as Omoda C5 EV or Chery Omoda E5 depending on the market) is the all-electric variant of the Omoda 5 compact crossover from Chery Automobile's premium-oriented Omoda sub-brand. Unveiled at Auto Shanghai in April 2023, it entered production in February 2024 and first went on sale in Indonesia in February 2024, followed by Australia in September 2024. Featuring Chery's 'Art in Motion' design language with a distinct front end styling compared to the petrol version, it lacks any Chery logo and branding. It is built on the T1X platform and powered by a front-mounted permanent magnet synchronous motor producing 150 kW (204 PS/201 hp) and 340 Nm of torque. The original battery option was a 61.06 kWh LFP battery pack, capable of 0-100 km/h acceleration in 7.2 seconds. Driving range varies by market certification but is approximately 430 km under NEDC standards. DC fast charging allows 30-80% charge in approximately 30 minutes. The interior features dual integrated 10.25-inch high-definition digital screens for driving, climate and entertainment controls. Available technology includes wireless smartphone charging, a Sony sound system, and advanced driver assistance systems including adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assistance, and autonomous emergency braking. The E5 represents Omoda's expansion into international markets including Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, Brazil, and various European countries."
