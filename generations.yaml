    description: "The OMODA 5 EV represents the all-electric variant of the OMODA 5 compact crossover from Chery Automobile's premium-oriented OMODA sub-brand. Featuring distinctive 'Art in Motion' design language with a sharp, angular aesthetic, split-level LED lighting elements, and a striking geometric pattern on its blanked-off grille. Built on a modified version of the platform used for the gasoline OMODA 5, it features a 61-64 kWh battery pack (depending on market) powering a front-mounted electric motor producing approximately 204 horsepower and 340 Nm of torque, capable of 0-100 km/h acceleration in around 7.8 seconds. Driving range varies by market certification standards but typically ranges from approximately 400-430 km (WLTP). DC fast charging capability allows charging from 30-80% in approximately 30 minutes. The minimalist interior features a clean, horizontal dashboard design with dual 12.3-inch screens—one serving as the digital instrument cluster and the other as the infotainment touchscreen—ambient lighting with 64 colors, and faux leather upholstery. Available technology includes wireless smartphone charging, a Sony sound system, and advanced driver assistance systems including adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assistance, and autonomous emergency braking. As OMODA's first global electric vehicle, the OMODA 5 EV represents the brand's expansion strategy into international markets including Australia, Europe, Asia, and South America, offering competitive range, features, and technology at a value-oriented price point compared to established competitors."
